title: "I created a tool to generate OGP and PWA images"
---

There's an app called [Image2icon](https://img2icnsapp.com/).

When building a website and adding PWA support, you need to prepare icons for both Android and iOS.

Creating these PWA-compatible icons can be a bit of a hassle, so I used to rely on that app.

However, PNG export is only available in the paid version, and it offers a lot of trimming features I didnâ€™t really need. It felt a bit too much for my use case.

So I decided to build a minimal image generator with just the essential outputs and basic trimming options.

Here it is:
ðŸ‘‰ [OGP Image Generator](https://ogpimggen.kkweb.io)

The tool currently outputs the following image types:

- `favicon.ico` (256px)
- `apple-icon.png` (180px)
- `icon-192x192.png` (192px)
- `icon-512x512.png` (512px)

I believe this set covers the minimum required icons for most PWA setups... though itâ€™s surprisingly hard to find consistent documentation on this.

Feel free to give it a tryâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear what you think!
