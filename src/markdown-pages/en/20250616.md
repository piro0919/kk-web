title: "The One Principle Behind Successful Teams"
---

Over the past few years, I’ve worked as a Scrum Master and gained quite a bit of experience.

One thing I’ve noticed is that there’s a fundamental difference in mindset between teams that move smoothly and those that don’t.

So today, I’d like to dig into that difference.

---

Let me start with the conclusion.

Whether or not something is “appropriate for the team’s actual capabilities” — this single perspective makes all the difference when deciding what to do and how to proceed.

---

This idea of being aligned with actual ability applies at every level — individuals, teams, departments, even entire companies.

When things are handled in a way that fits the actual capabilities, progress tends to go smoothly. When they’re not, things tend to go off the rails. It’s really that simple.

---

Take the role of the Product Owner, for example.

In Scrum, the Product Owner is primarily responsible for managing the Product Backlog.

They need to constantly steer the product in the right direction and deliver value to end users as quickly as possible. To do that, they must have a clear vision and break that down into the most effective backlog items.

But when a Product Owner’s ability doesn’t match the complexity of the role, developers are left thinking:

> “Why is the backlog taking so long to update?”
> “Why is it so hard to clarify the top items?”
> “Why aren’t the backlog items even properly ordered?”

Maybe the product is outside the PO’s mental model. Maybe it requires more management skill than they currently have. Or maybe they’re simply too slow at getting work done.

In any case, when someone takes on a role they’re not equipped for, they often become a bottleneck — and the whole team slows down. I’ve seen this happen more times than I can count.

---

The same goes for developers.

In Scrum, developers are expected to be cross-functional and self-organizing.

They’re responsible for delivering on the sprint goal, working closely with teammates, communicating effectively, and translating plans into working code.

But when developers aren’t quite at the level the project demands, things start falling apart mid-sprint. Progress slows down, and milestones slip.

Why does this happen?

Maybe their technical knowledge isn’t up to speed. Maybe they’re writing too many tests without thinking about the schedule. Or maybe they’ve created a tangled architecture without shared design rules.

In any case, when developers work beyond their level, quality suffers — and so does delivery speed. Again, I’ve seen this pattern repeat countless times.

---

So why do people take on things beyond their ability?

The simple answer: they overestimate themselves.

No matter the project, there are always unknowns at the start. It’s extremely rare to have a fully transparent, predictable development process.

Of course, with experience, the fog clears a little. But no two situations are exactly the same, and the environment is constantly changing. Unknowns are inevitable.

Still, I’ve found that people with just enough technical skill — or a few past successes under their belt — are the ones most likely to say:

> “It’ll probably work out somehow.”

But reality doesn’t go easy on us. It punishes that kind of optimism hard.

---

So then, how do we keep things moving smoothly?

My personal conclusion is: **Don’t be confident.**

Seriously. That’s it.

Now, as a Scrum Master, I often act as a motivator. On the surface, I’ll say things like:

> “Leave it to me!”
> “We’ll make it happen!”

But deep down, I’m always thinking:

> “Is this really okay?”
> “Am I making the wrong call?”

---

Even when I’m working with technologies I’ve used many times, I still check the official docs.

Even when I get help from AI tools, I second-guess the output:

> “Is this really accurate?”

And when I talk with people, I keep a mindset that’s honestly pretty close to:

> “Assume everyone’s hiding something.”

I’m always asking:

> “What’s their real intention?”
> “Is there something they’re not saying?”

That might sound a bit paranoid — or like I’m just unpleasant to work with — but I think this kind of skepticism is healthy. Normal, even.

In fact, I believe not having too much confidence is what actually allows things to move forward.

---

When I was little, my uncle once told me:

> “Assume most of what you see on TV is staged.”

That stuck with me. I think it’s kind of brilliant.

We should question things — including ourselves.

Sure, if you overthink it, you might start spiraling into negativity. You might feel depressed or anxious.

But maybe, just maybe, **that mindset is what helps you navigate things better in the long run.**

> **Instead of trusting yourself blindly, try doubting yourself just a little.
> It might actually be the fastest way forward.**
