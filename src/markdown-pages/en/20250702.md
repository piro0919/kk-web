title: "Firefox Add-ons I'm Using"
---

I've been a Firefox user for as long as I can remember.

Even though I know Chrome is probably more convenient in many ways, I still find myself sticking with Firefox.

So today, I thought I’d share some of the Firefox add-ons I use. I’ll mainly focus on the slightly unusual or niche ones.

## [&udm=14](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/udm-14/)

This add-on automatically appends `udm=14` to your Google search URLs.

It’s said to reduce the number of recent news articles that appear, giving you cleaner and more relevant results.

## [Amazon Unsponsor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-unsponsor/)

Hides sponsored products in Amazon search results.

I can’t stand sponsored listings, so this is a lifesaver.

## [Defund Wikipedia](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/defund-wikipedia/)

Hides donation banners on Wikipedia.

They’ve been getting more aggressive each year, so this one really helps.

## [Element Blocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/element-blocker/)

Lets you manually hide specific elements on websites.

Great for removing stubborn ads or pop-ups that ad blockers miss.

## [Infy Scroll - A Next Page AutoPager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/infy-scroll/)

Turns paginated websites into infinite scroll.

There are a few similar extensions, but so far this one feels the most stable and easy to use.

## [Measure-it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measure-it/)

Allows you to measure element sizes on websites.

Simple and intuitive. Very handy when working on site designs.

## [New Tab Homepage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-homepage/)

Opens a specific page whenever you open a new tab.

Honestly surprised this isn’t a default option.

## [Open bookmarks in new tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-bookmarks-in-a-new-tab/)

Makes bookmarks open in a new tab instead of the current one.

Again, surprised this isn’t built-in.

## [Open Graph Preview](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-graph-preview-and-debug/)

Lets you preview a page’s OGP (Open Graph Protocol) image.

Interesting to see how many websites forget to set one.

## [Open in Chrome™ Browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-chrome-browser/)

Adds a button that opens the current page in Chrome.

Super useful for cross-browser testing.

## [Open in Safari](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-safari/)

Same as above, but for Safari.

## [Pixiv Infinite Scroll](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixiv-infinite-scroll/)

Adds infinite scroll support to Pixiv.

Honestly, Pixiv’s default pagination is super outdated.

## [Progressive Web Apps for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/)

Surprisingly allows you to use PWAs in Firefox.

I didn’t expect this to work so smoothly — but it does!

## [QuickDrag WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quickdrag-we/)

Lets you select text and drag it to automatically search in your default search engine.

Great for eliminating the need to copy and paste.

## [Scroll To Top](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scroll-to-top/)

Adds a button to scroll back to the top of any page.

The design is a bit dated, but it’s really handy.

## [Show/Hide passwords](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/showhide-passwords/)

Adds a toggle to show or hide password fields.

Very helpful for those moments when you just need to see what you typed.

## [Text Link webext](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/text-link-webext/)

Allows you to double-click plain text URLs to open them in a new tab.

Great for browsing 2ch-style forums or anywhere with unlinked URLs.

## [Hide PR Items on Rakuten](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/%E6%A5%BD%E5%A4%A9%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89pr%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E3%82%92%E6%B6%88%E3%81%99/)

Hides PR (sponsored) items from Rakuten search results.

Another one I really appreciate — PR items are just noise to me.

That’s about it! I wonder how many of these have Chrome equivalents.

In any case, Firefox still feels a bit underground, and I kinda like that.
