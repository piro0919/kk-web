title: "Released a Note-Taking App with Cloud Sync"

...though that title might sound a bit dramatic.

To put it simply, I built a service where notes are saved in a cloud database and shared across devices as long as you're logged into the same account.

You can also use it **without logging in**, which is a key point.

In that case, notes are stored locally on your device, so they're only available on that one device.

Here's some extra info for those interested.

If you're wondering “What’s Convex?”, think of it as a cloud-based database with lots of built-in functionality.

I'm still just scratching the surface with it, but my impression so far is that their SDK is pretty powerful.

It feels perfect for small projects — easy and quick to get going.
That said, for larger-scale apps, you’ll have to really follow Convex’s way of doing things, which could be limiting.

As for implementation, about 20% of the code was written by Claude Code.

Most of the Convex-related parts were pretty much left up to it.
When I ran into issues deploying Clerk to production, I turned to ChatGPT for help and got through it.

One thing I learned: Clerk is super easy to use in development, but going live takes some proper setup.
It was a good learning experience.

I'm using only Google Auth for now — and obviously, it’s not quite as beginner-friendly as Firebase.

That’s about it.

It's also a PWA, so you can use it as an app on pretty much any device.

Since I released it with just the bare essentials, feel free to give it a try!
