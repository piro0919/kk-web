title: "Released a Service That Sorts Web Manga Sites by Update Day"
---

Thereâ€™s been a huge increase in web manga sites recently.

As a manga fan, I follow a bunch of themâ€”but Iâ€™ve completely lost track of which site updates when.

Thereâ€™s a site called [Web Manga Antenna](https://webcomics.jp/), but it doesnâ€™t cover many sources, which makes it a bit underwhelming for me.

Scraping each site to track updates for individual series sounds like a never-ending maintenance nightmare. So I decided to simplify things and only track updates at the site level, then organize them by day of the week.

That led me to create this service:

ðŸ‘‰ [ComicTime](https://comictime.kkweb.io/)

Since it works on a per-site basis, the usability isnâ€™t perfect.

Still, itâ€™s a lot more convenient than bookmarking dozens of sites. You can now save links by weekday per site, so hopefully that makes browsing easier.

The data is managed in a spreadsheet, so Iâ€™d love to have others help keep it up to date!

Below are some extra notes for those curious.

I donâ€™t usually use spreadsheets as databases, but for a small-scale project like this, it felt right.

As long as updates are limited to once per day, rate limits shouldnâ€™t be an issue.

Of course, type safety is out the windowâ€”but I accepted that and just used fetch in Next.js to build it quickly.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been making a lot of small web services, and I feel like Iâ€™m settling into a really solid development pattern.

Iâ€™ll probably write another blog post soon to share what that looks like.
