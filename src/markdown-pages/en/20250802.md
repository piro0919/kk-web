title: "Released: next-subrouter for Multi-Subdomain Routing in Next.js"
---

I've just released a new npm package called [**next-subrouter**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-subrouter), which enables support for multiple subdomains within a single Next.js project.

Since the README is written in English, I wanted to share a high-level overview and thoughts behind the package in blog form.

---

In many projects, especially in private development or early-stage products, it's common to want to deploy multiple services from a single monorepo—or even better, a single project.

Take a typical use case like this:

- Public site: `hogefuga.com`
- Admin portal: `studio.hogefuga.com`
- Internal tools: `admin.hogefuga.com`

Creating separate Next.js projects for each, maintaining shared components, managing linter/formatter configs, and deploying separately—it all becomes exhausting very quickly.

So I found myself thinking:

> “Can I please just manage all this in a single project?”

---

I brought the problem to ChatGPT, and it suggested I could solve it via **middleware**.

Then I turned to Claude Code for prototyping—and the results were surprisingly promising.

So I decided to generalize it and publish it as an npm package.

---

The package is still in an alpha state, so please don’t expect too much just yet.

It includes two variants:

- A basic version for single-language setups.
- An advanced version with **next-intl** integration, for multilingual support.

Even the next-intl version does **not** depend on next-intl directly, which keeps the implementation modular and customizable.

Basic usage is extremely simple. Here's a minimal example:

```ts
import { createSubrouterMiddleware, type SubRoutes } from "next-subrouter";

const subRoutes = [
  { path: "/admin", subdomain: "admin" },
  { path: "/studio", subdomain: "studio" },
  { path: "/user" }, // default route (no subdomain)
];

export const middleware = createSubrouterMiddleware(subRoutes);

export const config = {
  matcher: "/((?!api|trpc|_next|_vercel|.*\..*).*)",
};
```

It also works fine in local development—just update your `hosts` file to point subdomains to `localhost`.

---

One major benefit is that **you only need a single Vercel project**. That’s a huge win in terms of development cost and mental overhead.

Of course, there are trade-offs.

For instance, tools like `next-sitemap` may not fully support multi-domain setups out of the box—you’ll likely need to work around those.

Also, while subdomain-based routing is handled cleanly, things like `RootLayout` remain shared, so you’ll need to design layouts carefully for each persona.

Still, I believe the benefits far outweigh the downsides.

---

By the way, although it’s not in the README yet, this setup also works with authentication libraries like **Clerk**.

Here’s an extended example:

```ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import createIntlMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { createIntlSubrouterMiddleware } from "next-subrouter";
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { routing } from "./i18n/routing";

type Persona = "admin" | "studio" | "user";

const intlMiddleware = createIntlMiddleware(routing);
/**
 * Subdomain route configuration for next-subrouter
 */
const subRoutes = [
  { path: "/admin", subdomain: "admin" },
  { path: "/studio", subdomain: "studio" },
  { path: "/user" }, // default route (no subdomain)
];
/**
 * Create the subrouter middleware with internationalization
 */
const subrouterMiddleware = createIntlSubrouterMiddleware(
  subRoutes,
  intlMiddleware,
  {
    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
    defaultLocale: routing.defaultLocale,
    locales: [...routing.locales],
  },
);
/**
 * Public paths configuration for each persona
 */
const PUBLIC_PATHS: Record<Persona, string[]> = {
  admin: [
    "/:locale/sign-in(.*)",
    "/:locale/sign-up(.*)",
    "/sign-in(.*)",
    "/sign-up(.*)",
    "/api/webhooks(.*)",
  ],
  author: [
    "/:locale/sign-in(.*)",
    "/:locale/sign-up(.*)",
    "/sign-in(.*)",
    "/sign-up(.*)",
    "/api/webhooks(.*)",
  ],
  user: [
    "/",
    "/:locale",
    "/:locale/sign-in(.*)",
    "/:locale/sign-up(.*)",
    "/sign-in(.*)",
    "/sign-up(.*)",
    "/api/webhooks(.*)",
  ],
};
/**
 * Cached route matchers for each persona to avoid recreation
 */
const routeMatchers = new Map<Persona, ReturnType<typeof createRouteMatcher>>();

/**
 * Creates or returns cached route matcher for the given persona
 */
function isPublicRouteFor(
  persona: Persona,
): ReturnType<typeof createRouteMatcher> {
  if (!routeMatchers.has(persona)) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line security/detect-object-injection
    const paths = PUBLIC_PATHS[persona];

    routeMatchers.set(persona, createRouteMatcher(paths));
  }

  return routeMatchers.get(persona)!;
}

/**
 * Cached persona detection to avoid repeated string operations
 */
const personaCache = new Map<string, Persona>();
/**
 * Create subdomain lookup map from subRoutes configuration
 */
const subdomainToPersonaMap = new Map<string, Persona>(
  subRoutes
    .filter((route) => Boolean(route.subdomain))
    .map((route) => [route.subdomain!, route.path.slice(1) as Persona]),
);

/**
 * Determines the persona (application section) based on subdomain with caching
 */
function getPersonaFromHostname(hostname: string): Persona {
  if (personaCache.has(hostname)) {
    return personaCache.get(hostname)!;
  }

  // Extract subdomain from hostname
  const subdomain = hostname.split(".")[0];
  const persona = subdomainToPersonaMap.get(subdomain) ?? "user";

  personaCache.set(hostname, persona);

  return persona;
}

/**
 * Main middleware function that handles multi-domain routing with internationalization and authentication
 */
export default clerkMiddleware(
  async (auth, request: NextRequest): Promise<NextResponse> => {
    // Skip processing for static files to improve performance
    const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;

    if (
      pathname.includes(".") &&
      !pathname.includes(".json") &&
      !pathname.includes(".html")
    ) {
      return NextResponse.next();
    }

    // First, apply subrouter middleware for subdomain routing and internationalization
    const subrouterResponse = subrouterMiddleware(request);
    // Handle authentication based on the original request's subdomain
    const hostname = request.headers.get("host");

    if (!hostname) {
      return subrouterResponse;
    }

    const cleanHostname = hostname.split(":")[0];
    const persona = getPersonaFromHostname(cleanHostname);
    // Check if route is public before doing expensive auth operations
    const isPublicRoute = isPublicRouteFor(persona);

    if (isPublicRoute(request)) {
      return subrouterResponse;
    }

    // Perform auth check for protected routes
    const { redirectToSignIn, userId } = await auth();

    if (!userId) {
      const signInResponse = redirectToSignIn();

      return NextResponse.redirect(signInResponse.url, signInResponse);
    }

    return subrouterResponse;
  },
  { debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" },
);

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    "/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)",
    // Always run for API routes
    "/(api|trpc)(.*)",
  ],
};
```

No plans to officially support Clerk in the package for now—but feel free to adapt as needed.

That’s all for now! It’s been a while since I’ve released something this large to npm.

That said, I delegated 100% of the code generation to Claude Code—which made development shockingly easy.

Still, prompts need to be well thought-out, and unless you already understand the spec, you’ll burn through tokens fast or get unexpected results.

So stay sharp—but have fun.

Hope it helps someone out there!
