title: "Released use-right-click"

I recently released a new npm package called [use-right-click](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-right-click).

It’s a **very small and simple hook** that lets you intercept and replace right-click behavior.

## Why I made this

In many applications, you often want to treat:

- Right-click on desktop
- Long-press on mobile

as the _same interaction_.

However, implementing this usually means manually wiring multiple DOM events for each component — and that gets tedious very quickly.

When I looked around, I was surprised that there wasn’t a small, focused package that simply handled this case.

So I decided to make one.

## About the package

`use-right-click` is intentionally minimal.

It does one thing:

> Unify right-click and long-press into a single, clean interaction.

If it saves you even a little time, I’d be very happy 😊

Feel free to use it.
