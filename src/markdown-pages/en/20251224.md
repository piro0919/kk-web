title: "Looking Back on What I Wrote in 2025"
---

Since I started using note this year, this blog has gradually become a place where I mostly write about development and gadgets.

I’ve been pretty absorbed in note lately, but since it’s the end of the year, I thought I’d take a moment to look back on some of the things I wrote about this year and how they turned out afterward.

## SwitchBot Learning Remote

I’m still using it — and honestly, it’s still very convenient.

The fact that it’s USB-C rechargeable is great, and once you get used to it, having just a single remote makes everything feel much cleaner and simpler.

I still use the original remote for Fire TV, but I don’t really have any major complaints about that one either.

## About Macopy

Even though I made it myself, I’m not actually using it anymore.
Electron just turned out to be a bit too heavy for this kind of thing.

These days I’m simply using [Maccy](https://maccy.app/).

The settings are a little awkward to deal with, but it works perfectly fine and I don’t really have any problems with it.

By the way, I’m also using [IINA](https://iina.io/) instead of Mac Classic Player, and that’s been completely fine as well.

Though to be honest, I still kind of like Mac Classic Player better.

## The 3,600-yen Android Tablet

I use it when playing electronic drums along with YouTube, and I’m using it a lot.

The responsiveness isn’t amazing, but since I’m very specific about how I use it, it rarely causes any real problems.

What I really appreciate is that my old iPad mini could go back to being my everyday device again.

## iPad Air

I bought an iPad Air to use as a secondary display for my MacBook.

With Apple’s official mirroring, though, it wouldn’t reflect the iPad’s native Retina resolution, which made it extremely awkward to use.

Yam Display wasn’t very stable either, so it was a bit of a letdown at first.

After writing that article, I did a bit more digging and found an app called [Display Menu](http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de/).

With this, even under Apple’s official mirroring, you can change the resolution to ones that aren’t normally supported — and when I tried it, it worked perfectly.

So in the end, I’m really glad I bought the iPad Air. The cable setup is cleaner now, and it’s honestly great.

## Kindle Paperwhite

I’m still using it, but there are still quite a few bugs.

The most serious one is that the book covers in the library often don’t display, so you end up only seeing the titles, which is pretty bad.

The controls feel a bit unique, but once you get used to them, they’re tolerable.

That said, the overall responsiveness is still pretty sluggish.
All things considered, the iPad mini is far better.

On the other hand, the battery life is impressive — it lasts much longer than I expected.

Still, I don’t think it’s a device I can wholeheartedly recommend.

There were more little discoveries than I expected when I looked back.

If any of this ends up being helpful to someone, I’ll be happy.
