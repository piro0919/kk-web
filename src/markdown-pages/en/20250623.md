title: "I Bought an Android Tablet for 3,600 Yen"
---

AliExpress was having a summer sale.

I was casually browsing for something interesting and came across an Android tablet priced at just 3,600 yen (about $22 USD).

At that price, even if it turned out to be junk, I figured it would be worth the risk—so I bought it.

[URAO 10-inch Tablet Android 14 8GB (3+5 extended) RAM 64GB ROM 1TB Expandable 1280x800 IPS Screen 5000mAh Battery Dual Camera WiFi 6](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/1005009091027764.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2jpn)

As of writing, its original price was listed as 6,556 yen, which is incredibly cheap.

Even among the many Chinese tablets on Amazon, this one stood out for its low price.

Interestingly, it’s also available on Amazon Japan:

[10-inch Android 14 Tablet, Wi-Fi Model, Octa-Core CPU, 8GB+64GB+1TB Expandable, 1280\*800 IPS Display, Anti-Smudge Mesh Design, Widevine L1 Support, 5MP+8MP Camera, BT5.4, Long Battery Life, Split Screen, Wireless Casting (Black)](https://amzn.to/4nbZWvJ)

So, here are the specs:

| Item        | Spec           |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| OS          | Android 14     |
| CPU         | A523 Octa-Core |
| RAM         | 8GB            |
| Storage     | 64GB           |
| Resolution  | 1280 x 800 px  |
| Screen Size | 10.1 inch      |
| Battery     | 5000mAh        |
| Weight      | 490g           |

On paper, the specs aren’t bad at all.

And after booting it up, everything matched what was advertised.

Here’s my breakdown of the pros, the okay stuff, and the drawbacks.

---

## Pros

### It's cheap

Obviously. No complaints here.

### It's lightweight

Under 500g — surprisingly light. Very portable.

---

## Just Okay

### Decent sound quality

It’s not hollow or tinny. Not great either, but acceptable for casual video watching.

### Usable performance

App performance is fine when used one at a time. YouTube runs pretty smoothly.

But it struggles when multitasking—for example, using split-screen to read Kindle while watching YouTube gets laggy.

### Mediocre display

The resolution could be better, but honestly, it’s doing well for this price range.

---

## Cons

### The OS is janky

This is a big one for me. It seems like the OS has been heavily modified in weird ways.

In particular, the recent apps menu behaves oddly—it feels like the default Android behavior has been overridden in a not-so-great way.

### Battery drains fast

The battery seems to drain unusually quickly. I’ll need to use it more, but so far, it doesn’t look promising.

### Thick bezels

This is common with budget Chinese tablets—probably a cost-cutting measure.

---

## Final Thoughts

For 3,600 yen, I’m pretty satisfied.

But if you have a 10,000 yen budget, you could definitely get something better.

Still, if you’re comparing this to the [Fire HD 10](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0C2XN8HKD/ref=ods_cp_tab_tun?tag=piro09190c-22&th=1) which costs around 20,000 yen, I’d say a cheap Chinese tablet like this is a better deal.
