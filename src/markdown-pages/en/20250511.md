title: "I Moved to a New Domain"
---

I’ve moved from `kk-web.link` to `kkweb.io`.

Lately, I’d been thinking things like _“Ugh, I don’t like having a hyphen in the domain”_ and _“.link feels kinda meaningless,”_ so I finally got around to changing it.

I’ll keep redirects from the old domain for about two months, but after that, I plan to let it go — just a heads-up.

All services that were running on subdomains have also been migrated. Probably.
