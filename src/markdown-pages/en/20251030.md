title: "Kindle Paperwhite (12th Gen) vs iPad mini (6th Gen): A Hands-on Comparison"
---

I impulsively bought the Kindle Paperwhite (12th Gen)￼.

It just so happened to be on sale—33,000 yen down to 28,000 yen—so I figured, why not?

After using it for two or three days, I wanted to share my overall impressions. Since I normally read Kindle books on my iPad mini (6th Gen), this post is a quick comparison of both devices—the pros and cons from my perspective.

---

## Background

For context: I hardly ever read novels. I mainly read manga.

## What’s Good About the Kindle Paperwhite

### Light and Slim

It’s noticeably smaller and lighter than the iPad mini.

Definitely more portable and easier to carry around.

### Easy on the Eyes

It really does feel gentler on the eyes.

That glossy glare you get from the iPad mini just isn’t there. For long reading sessions, this is a big advantage.

### You Can Buy Books Directly

Obviously, being an Amazon device, you can buy Kindle books directly on it.

With the Amazon Store app no longer available on Android, this is surprisingly convenient.

### Usable in the Bath

It’s waterproof, so apparently you can use it in the bath.

I haven’t tried it yet, but I’m curious how well the touchscreen works when wet.

### Great Resolution

The display resolution is high enough that I have zero complaints.

Everything looks crisp and clean.

## The Neutral Points

### Battery Life Isn’t Amazing

It’s marketed as having a "12-week battery," but honestly, it drains faster than I expected.

Maybe it’s because I mainly read manga, but still—it’s fine, just not miraculous.

### Slippery Body

The body isn’t matte, so it tends to slip out of your hand.

A case might be essential.

### Slightly Large in the Hand

It’s about the size of a paperback book plus a bezel, so one-handed use isn’t super easy.

That said, it’s probably as compact as it can reasonably get.

---

## The Not-So-Good

### Lots of Small, Annoying Bugs

Missing thumbnails in the library, unoptimized page layouts, inverted manga colors in dark mode…

The list goes on. Hard to believe this is acceptable quality for a released product.

### Sluggish Performance and Awkward Scrolling

It’s not unbearably slow, but far from snappy.

Scrolling feels weirdly choppy—like a slideshow flipping pages rather than smooth scrolling.

Pretty frustrating at times.

### Poor Usability

Combine the sluggish performance with mediocre UX, and it’s just not a pleasant experience.

It feels like they embedded the Kindle app straight into the device—but somehow worse.

Customization is also very limited.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I can’t really recommend it.

If you’re spending around 30,000 yen, you’d probably be much happier stretching a bit more for an iPad mini.

That said, the Paperwhite does have a few advantages the iPad mini doesn’t:

- Screen size optimized for reading
- Lighter weight
- Easier on the eyes
- Waterproof (bath-friendly)
- Cheaper

If you mainly read novels, it could be a solid option.

But personally, the iPad mini wins easily for me—the sluggish scrolling and dark-mode bugs are deal-breakers.

In short, the Paperwhite isn’t great value for money and really only suits a niche group of readers.

If you’re considering one, do so carefully.
