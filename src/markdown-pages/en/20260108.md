title: "I Released High or Low"

A bit late, but happy new year.

I’m planning to keep writing down what I learn this year as well, so thank you in advance.

---

At the very beginning of the year, I released a small web service.

[High or Low](https://high-low.kkweb.io)

I built this as a simple “tension tracker” at a coworker’s request.

It’s completely free, no ads, no nonsense — feel free to use it if you like.

The tech stack looks like this:

- Supabase
- TanStack Query
- Motion
- Next.js
- next-intl
- next-themes
- React
- React Swipeable
- Recharts
- Serwist
  - @serwist/turbopack
- Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn/ui
- web-push
- Biome
- Lefthook
- Vercel

Lately, I’ve been really enjoying the Supabase + Vercel (+ Cloudflare) combination.

It’s not as heavy as AWS or GCP, not as restrictive as Firebase, and still quite maintainable.
Feels like we’re living in a pretty good era.

---

I implemented PWA support with Serwist and combined it with push notifications.

This area is still pretty hard to debug, so the hurdle feels a bit high —
but I more or less brute-forced it with “vibe coding,” and I’m glad I managed to work through the rough spots.

---

The flow of
**Vercel Cron → Next.js API Routes → Supabase → Push Notifications**
feels quite clean to me.

That said, from a locality and cost perspective it’s not perfect, so that’s something to revisit later…
though in absolute terms, the cost is still pretty small.

---

The repository is also public, in case you’re interested.

This time, even the icons are generated via API Routes, which turned out to be pretty fun.
